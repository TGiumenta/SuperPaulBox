## Game Goals
Navigate to the end of the level by using your weapon to defeat enemies along the way! \
Enemies are worth varying amounts of points, so stay as long as you like and try to beat the high score! \
Be careful: The timer is only 2 minutes long, and if you happen to take too long, you cannot save the princess.
